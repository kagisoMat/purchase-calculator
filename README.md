#Purchase Calculator 🛒

A Python-based calculator that computes the total price of items purchased, including sales tax. This project showcases core Python concepts such as input handling, performing calculations, error handling, and saving data to a file. It's designed for simplicity but with real-world practicality in mind.

## Features:
- 🖥️ **Input Handling**: Allows users to input item prices and quantities, with validation to prevent errors.
- 💸 **Sales Tax Calculation**: Automatically applies an 8% sales tax and computes the total cost.
- 🧾 **Receipt Generation**: Option to save the purchase summary as a `receipt.txt` file.
- 🔄 **Multiple Calculations**: Users can perform multiple transactions in a single session.
- 🚫 **Error Handling**: Prevents invalid inputs and provides user-friendly error messages.

## **Technologies Used:**
- **Python 3.x**
- **PyCharm** (or any IDE of your choice)

## **How to Use:**
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/purchase-calculator.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd purchase-calculator
   ```
3. Run the program:
   ```bash
   python purchase_calculator.py
   ```

## **Future Improvements**:
- Adding a graphical user interface (GUI) using `Tkinter` or `PyQt`.
- Integrating with a simple database to track and store purchase history.
